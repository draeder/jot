# Testing the Paging System

## Problem
The directional paging indicators are not appearing even though cards exist off-screen.

## Current Implementation
1. **State Management**: `pageIndicators` state with left/right/up/down booleans
2. **Calculation Logic**: `calculatePageIndicators()` function with viewport bounds detection
3. **UI Components**: Chevron buttons positioned at viewport edges
4. **Navigation**: `navigateToDirection()` function for moving to off-screen cards

## Debug Steps Added
1. **Console Logging**: Added extensive debug output in `calculatePageIndicators()`
2. **Visual Debug**: Added purple debug panel showing indicator states
3. **Test Buttons**: Added directional test buttons to create cards off-screen

## Testing Plan
1. Sign in to the app using local credentials
2. Create a workspace
3. Use the directional test buttons (← → ↑ ↓) to create cards off-screen
4. Observe if the directional indicators appear
5. Check browser console for debug output

## Expected Behavior
- When cards exist off-screen, corresponding directional indicators should appear
- Clicking indicators should navigate to show those cards
- Debug panel should reflect the correct state

## Known Working Components
- UI elements are rendered conditionally based on `pageIndicators` state
- Navigation function exists and has proper positioning logic
- Debug logging is in place to track viewport bounds and card positions
